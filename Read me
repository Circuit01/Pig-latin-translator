# Pig Latin Translator

## Overview
This Python script provides a simple translator between English and Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a playful language game where words in English are altered according to specific rules. The script includes two main functions: one for converting English words to Pig Latin and another for converting Pig Latin words back to English.

## How It Works

### Functions

1. **`english_to_pig_latin(word)`**
   - **Purpose**: Converts an English word into Pig Latin.
   - **Rules**:
     - If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), simply add "ay" to the end of the word.
     - If the word starts with a consonant, move the initial consonant cluster to the end of the word and add "ay".
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `hello`
     - Output: `ellohay`

2. **`pig_latin_to_english(word)`**
   - **Purpose**: Converts a Pig Latin word back into English.
   - **Rules**:
     - Remove the "ay" suffix from the end of the word.
     - Move the consonant cluster (which was moved to the end in the Pig Latin conversion) back to the beginning of the word.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: `ellohay`
     - Output: `hello`

### How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment. It will display a menu with options to convert between English and Pig Latin or to exit the program.

2. **Menu Options**:
   - **1. English to Pig Latin**: Enter an English word to get its Pig Latin translation.
   - **2. Pig Latin to English**: Enter a Pig Latin word to get its English translation.
   - **3. Exit**: Exit the program.

3. **Input**:
   - Enter the word you want to translate when prompted. The input is automatically converted to lowercase to ensure consistent processing.

4. **Output**:
   - The script will display the translated word based on the chosen conversion.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
1. English to Pig Latin
2. Pig Latin to English
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter an English word: apple
Pig Latin: appleay

1. English to Pig Latin
2. Pig Latin to English
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2
Enter a Pig Latin word: appleay
English: apple
```

## Notes
- The script assumes that input words are in lowercase and do not contain punctuation or special characters.
- If a word does not follow standard Pig Latin rules or if the rules are not strictly applied, the script may not produce expected results.

## Running the Script
To run the script, ensure you have Python installed. Save the code to a file named `pig_latin_translator.py`, and execute it using the command:

```sh
python pig_latin_translator.py
```
